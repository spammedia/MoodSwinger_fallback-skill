## polie-fallbackskill
Fallback for when Mycroft doesn't know the answer

Install prereq picotts with 'sudo apt-get install libttspico-utils' first!

## Description 
 
Add more politeness to your Mycroft now!

Does a couple of things:
- It repeats the utterance with a low pitched en-GB voice through picotts
- it does a polite r2d2 robot-like impression, 
- it gives a remark from the dialog file.

Edit the polite dialog file to suit your own taste.

## Examples 
* "Hey Mycroft, blah blah blah"
* Answer: "That's a wonderful idea sir"

* "Hey Mycroft, yada yada yada"
* Answer: "Would you please be so kind as to repeat that?"
