## MoodSwinger fallback skill

Fallback for when Mycroft doesn't know the answer.
Install prereq picotts with 'sudo apt-get install -y libttspico-utils' first!

## Description 

Add more personality to your Mycroft now! Choose between the following types:
1.Sassi, 2.Classy, 3.Creepy, or 4.Borg

* "set attitude" + number

Does a few things:
- It repeats the utterance with a pitched en-GB voice through picotts
- it does a r2d2 robot-like impression
- it gives a remark from the appropriate dialog file

Edit the dialog files to suit your own taste.

## Examples
* "Hey Mycroft, set attitude 2"
(This sets Mycroft's mood to Classy)

* "Hey Mycroft, blah blah blah"
* Answer: "Supreme attempt at a question, truly world-class"

* "Hey Mycroft, yada yada yada"
* Answer: "You sound awfully clever"
