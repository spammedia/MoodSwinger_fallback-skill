Fallback for when Mycroft doesn't know the answer

Install prereq picotts with 'sudo apt-get libttspico-utils' first!

## Description 
 
Add more sarcasm to your Mycroft now!
It repeats the utterance with a high pitched en-GB voice through picotts
or it does a great r2d2 impression, or it gives a remark from the dialog file.

## Examples 
* "Hey Mycroft, blah blah blah"
* "Hey Mycroft, destroy the death star"
* "Hey Mycroft, Hack my wifi"
