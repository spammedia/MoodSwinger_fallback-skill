Under Construction..

Fallback for when Mycroft doesn't know the answer
Install prereq picotts with 'sudo apt-get install -y libttspico-utils' first!

## Description 
 
Add more personality to your Mycroft now! Choose between the following types:
1.Sassi, 2.Classy, 3.Creepy, or 4.Borg

Does a couple of things:
- It repeats the utterance with a high pitched en-GB voice through picotts
- it does a r2d2 robot-like impression, 
- it gives a remark from the dialog file.

Edit the polite dialog file to suit your own taste.

## Examples
* "Hey Mycroft, set attitude two"
(This sets Mycroft's mood to Classy)

* "Hey Mycroft, blah blah blah"
* Answer: "Supreme attempt at a question, truly world-class."

* "Hey Mycroft, yada yada yada"
* Answer: "You sound awfully clever"
