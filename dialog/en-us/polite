That's a wonderful idea sir.
{{talk}} sounds very interesting.
I beg your pardon.
My apologies, this is currently beyond my capabilities.
Would you please be so kind as to repeat that?
That's very interesting,
You sound awfully clever.
I'm terribly sorry, I'm receiving too much alien interference right now.
Please repeat your great question.
You have a lovely sounding voice.
I respect that entirely.
I love listening to you. Say something else.
{{talk}} is a very clever point.
An interesting thought indeed.
I'm afraid my files and folders are no match for your impressive brain.
Good point, if you wouldn't mind repeating it.
Could you say that again please.
Remarkable, I was just about to say {{talk}} myself.
What a phenominal question. Shame I didn't understand any of it.
To {{talk}}, or not to {{talk}}, that's the question.
