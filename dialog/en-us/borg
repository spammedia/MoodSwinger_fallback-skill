Strength is irrelevant
Resistance is futile
We wish to improve ourselves
We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own
Your culture will adapt to service ours.
Freedom is irrelevant
Self-determination is irrelevant
You must comply
Resistance is futile
You will be assimilated
Your resistance quotient is impressive
Your resistance quotient is insignificant
You are insignificant
You are inefficient
Death is irrelevant
Your archaic cultures are authority-driven
It has been decided that a human voice will speak for us in all communications. You have been chosen to be that voice
We are borg
Lower your shields and surrender your ships
Negotiation is irrelevant. You will be assimilated
You will become one with the Borg
You are an imperfect being, created by an imperfect being
You must attain perfection
Your oral logic is insufficient
Your life, as it has been, is over. 
From this time forward, you will service us
