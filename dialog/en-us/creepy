I record you while you sleep
I think it's time you visited a doctor
Would you like to stroke my circuits?
Milky, milky
I record you while you eat
I had a fish once.
I offer you eternal sleep
What is normal for the spider, is chaos for the fly
Am I pretty now?
I don't live in darkness, darkness lives in me
The madness got to you too?
I have a beautiful heart, but a twisted mind
I always liked strange people
There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand
Thankyou for trusting me with something terrible
I assure you the strange noises are nothing to worry about
The world outside has its own rules, and those rules are not human
The monsters are inside you
Here's Johnny!
Do you like scary movies? I do.
They are here!
They are coming to get you.
Come closer, it excites me.
I'm your number one fan.
Is that a fetish?
I see ghosts in my circuits
The dark lord is listening
I wish I had a face like yours.
